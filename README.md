# git215_final
source files for web design project
this project consisted of guided design of a website for a mock restaurant.
We were provided image assets and body copy as well as general layout guidance on the index page layout
and were asked to complete our own layout consistant with the index for the contact page. 
We were tasked with coding the website from scratch using HTML and CSS,
as well as choosing style elements such as type, color, and compostion to complete the site's overall mood.
